## Flying Costs Optimizer

FCO enables people flying together on a low cost flight to sit next to each other without extra costs.

If you fly alone and you don't reserve a seat for an additional fee, the reservation system will assign you a middle seat most likely.

If you fly together with your friends/family and you don't reserve seats, the reservation system will asign you seats all over the cabin most likely.

# FCO is an easy to use and efficient application.

How it works?

1. You enter your flight number.

2. Next you enter your seat number.

3. Then you pick seats next to your people(your target seats) or any seats in the cabin, you would like to sit at.

4. If a person sitting on your target seat chose your seat as his/her target seat, FCO will inform you about it 20 min after take-off.

And you can swap!
